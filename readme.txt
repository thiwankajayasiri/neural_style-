## all the notes books runs on Google Colab 
## set the run time seetings to TPU
## have commented the whole process of the style transfer
## NST_EE - EE stands for Eager execution models and 
## OM - Original Method
## PM - Proposed Method

## There are four .ipynb files the , the NST_OGM  NST_PGM files run on the original code version with the tweak of the gram matrix. 
   Since it takes rouhgly about 3 to 4 hours to run the 1000 iterations have used the eager execution method which has demostrated in NST_EE .ipynb note books.


##Images: Links to the images been provided in the colab, we could have images uploaded to the google drive and load it from there, I've given a genearl way to use for easier execution of the code.
